This is a program coded in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for 2018 BC Calculus Final Project. Clicking the pencil will open a scorekeeper in which you can initialize the number of teams and then add points to each team as the game progresses. When the game is over, click 'Game Over' and it will reveal the winner.

This site was created by: YuYu Madigan, Anna Banyas, Cerise Nowjack, and Tad Grindeland for Mr. Druker's 2018 BC Calc Class.
